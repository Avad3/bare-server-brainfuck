# bare-server-brainfuck
[Bare server implementation](https://github.com/TompHTTP/specifications) written in brainfuck using the [systemf interpreter](https://github.com/ajyoon/systemf).

With systemf, you're able to make linux syscalls with the `%` operator, making a bare server implementation possible.
